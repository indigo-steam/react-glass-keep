## ✨ Features

* **Auth & Multi-user**
  * Register, Login (username + password), Sign out
  * **Optional dev seed:** `admin` / `admin` only when `SEED_DEFAULT_ADMIN=true` (dev only) ✅
  * **Secret recovery key** download + **Sign in with Secret Key**
  * Each user sees **only their notes**

* **Private AI Assistant (per-user agent + BYOK)** ✅ NEW
  * **One Hermes agent per user** — each account gets its own isolated agent instance
    (separate container, memory and credentials); no shared multi-tenant memory.
  * **Your own API key (BYOK)** — connect OpenRouter or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint from
    the app UI; keys are stored **encrypted at rest** (AES-256-GCM) and never reach the browser.
  * **Note-aware via MCP** — the agent reads/writes your notes through the GlassKeep MCP
    (search, read, create, update, archive); it never touches the database directly.
  * **Durable memory** — instructions you give ("when I tell you the mileage, update note X")
    persist across sessions and devices.
  * **Bring your own agent too** — the MCP also works with Claude Desktop, your own Hermes,
    Cursor, etc. (see [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/README.md)).

* **Collaboration (real-time)** ✅ NEW

  * Real-time collaboration for checklists — multiple people can add/tick items together and see updates instantly.
  * Collaboration on notes — co-edit Markdown notes and watch changes sync across collaborators.
  * **Add and remove collaborators** — invite users by username/email to collaborate on your notes.

## 📦 Project Structure

```
.
├─ public/                # PWA icons, manifest generated by Vite plugin
├─ src/                   # React app (App.jsx, etc.)
├─ server/                # Express + SQLite API (index.js, data.sqlite on runtime)

## 🛠 Setup (Development)

### 1) Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

### 2) Configure dev env (`.env.local`)

The server loads `.env.local` automatically in development:

```env
JWT_SECRET=dev-local-secret
SECRETS_MASTER_KEY=<openssl rand -base64 32>   # required for the assistant vault (BYOK)
DB_FILE=./data/dev.sqlite
API_PORT=8080
NODE_ENV=development
ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true
SEED_DEFAULT_ADMIN=true                        # optional: seeds admin/admin (dev only)
ADMIN_EMAILS=your-admin-username
```

### 3) Run (web + API)

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Frontend (Vite): http://localhost:5173
- API: http://localhost:8080
  *(Vite dev server proxies `/api` → `http://localhost:8080`.)*

**Promote an existing user to admin (optional):**
```sql
-- Run against your dev DB (DB_FILE)
UPDATE users SET is_admin=1 WHERE email='your-admin-username';
```

### 3) Docker (Local Development)

**Quick Local Docker Script:**
```bash
./local_docker_run.sh
```

**Or manually:**
```bash
docker build -t glass-keep:local .

docker rm -f glass-keep 2>/dev/null || true

docker run -d \
  --name glass-keep \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e API_PORT=8080 \
  -e JWT_SECRET=dev-please-change \
  -e DB_FILE=/app/data/notes.db \
  -e ADMIN_EMAILS=admin \
  -e ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false \
  -v "$HOME/.glass-keep:/app/data" \ # Change path according to OS (e.g., %USERPROFILE%\.glass-keep on Windows)
  glass-keep:local
```

### Build & Run (from this repo)

```bash
# Build the image locally
docker build -t indigo-notes:local .

# Create data dir
mkdir -p ~/.glass-keep

# Generate secrets (never commit them)
JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 48)"
SECRETS_MASTER_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"

# Run
docker run -d \
  --name indigo-notes \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8082:8080 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e API_PORT=8080 \
  -e JWT_SECRET="$JWT_SECRET" \
  -e SECRETS_MASTER_KEY="$SECRETS_MASTER_KEY" \
  -e DB_FILE="/app/data/notes.db" \
  -e ADMIN_EMAILS="your-admin-username" \
  -e ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false \
  -v ~/.glass-keep:/app/data \
  indigo-notes:local
```

- Proxy it over HTTPS (nginx/caddy) to `127.0.0.1:8082`
- Admin: create the first account with the email listed in `ADMIN_EMAILS`

### docker-compose.yml (app only)

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    image: indigo-notes:local
    container_name: indigo-notes
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - ~/.glass-keep/indigo-notes.env   # NODE_ENV, JWT_SECRET, SECRETS_MASTER_KEY, ...
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8082:8080"
    volumes:
      - ~/.glass-keep:/app/data
```

Run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.glass-keep
docker compose up -d --build
```

> **Persistent data:** the notes DB lives in `~/.glass-keep` on your host.

## 🧭 Using the Admin Panel

- **Where**
  - Dev: http://localhost:5173/#/admin
  - Docker/Prod: http://localhost:8080/#/admin
- **Who can access**: Users with `is_admin = 1`.
  - Auto-promote by setting `ADMIN_EMAILS="your-admin-username"` before starting the server/container, **or**
  - Run a one-off SQL update:
    ```sql
    UPDATE users SET is_admin=1 WHERE email='your-admin-username';
    ```
> **Note:** If registration is disabled (default), you can use the default admin account to log in for the first time:
> - **Username:** `admin`
> - **Password:** `admin`
> 
> After logging in, you can create new users or change the admin password in the Admin Panel.
- **What you can do**
  - View all users with: **Is Admin**, **Notes count**, **Storage used**, **Created at**
  - **Delete** a user (also removes their notes; cannot delete the last admin)

> The admin view is intentionally not in the main header menu. Navigate to the route directly.

## 🧭 Usage Guide

* **Create a note**

  * Choose **Text / Checklist / Drawing** in the composer toggle. ✅ NEW
  * For text notes: Enter a *Title* and content.
  * For checklists: Add checklist items and toggle them as needed.
  * For drawings: Draw freehand with customizable brush sizes and colors. ✅ NEW
  * Add **tags** (comma-separated) — they become chips.
  * Choose a **color**, attach **images**, then click **Add Note**.

* **Markdown editing**

  * Use the **Formatting** button (Aa) in the composer or modal edit mode:

    * H1/H2/H3, **bold**, *italic*, ~~strike~~, `inline code`, `fenced code`, quote, lists, link
  * **Smart Enter** continues lists or exits on empty line.

* **Open / Edit**

  * Click a card to open the modal.
  * Modal header has **View / Edit** toggle, **Pin**, **⋮ (Download .md)**, and **Close**.
  * Click edit button in the body to switch to edit mode.

* **Images**

  * Click a modal image to open **Fullscreen Viewer** (download, next/prev).
  * Images are compressed client-side on upload.

* **Pin & Reorder**

  * Use the pin icon on a card or modal header.
  * Drag cards to reorder within **Pinned** or **Others**.
  * **Drag checklist items** to reorder them within a checklist note. ✅ NEW
  * **Toggle checklist items** directly from the notes grid without opening the modal. ✅ NEW

* **Tags & Filters**

  * Open the **hamburger menu** → sidebar lists all tags + counts.
  * Quick filters: **Notes (All)**, **All Images**.

* **Search & AI Assistance**
  * **Deep Search**: searches across title, Markdown text, tags, checklist items, and image names.
  * **AI mode**: the **star ✨** in the search bar toggles AI mode on/off (it auto-enables once
    your assistant is configured). Type a question and hit the **send arrow** (or Enter).
  * **Per-user agent**: answers come from *your* Hermes agent using *your* notes via the MCP,
    with streaming responses and durable memory.
  * **Configure it in-app**: Settings → **AI Assistant: provider & API key** (OpenRouter or
    any OpenAI-compatible endpoint; key stored encrypted).

* **Export / Import**

  * Header **⋮** → **Export** to JSON (backup/sharing).
  * **Import** JSON merges with existing notes (keeps existing).

* **Secret Key**

  * Header **⋮** → **Download secret key (.txt)**.
  * On login screen, choose **Forgot username/password? → Sign in with Secret Key**.

* **Collaboration**

  * Open a note and click the **collaboration icon** (👥) in the modal header.
  * Add collaborators by username or email — they can view and edit the note.
  * View current collaborators and remove them if needed. ✅ NEW
  * Changes sync in real-time across all collaborators.

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

* Treat your **Secret Key** like a password. Anyone with it can sign in as you.
* Always set a long, random `JWT_SECRET` in production (generate with `openssl rand -base64 48`).
* Set `SECRETS_MASTER_KEY` to store user LLM keys encrypted (AES-256-GCM); it is required
  for the assistant's BYOK vault.
* User API keys are never returned to the browser (only `••••last4`) and never logged.
* The assistant reads/writes notes only through the REST API with the user's own credential
  (never SQLite, never an admin token).
* Serve over HTTPS in production for PWA and security best practices.

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

* **Dev proxy error (`ECONNREFUSED` to `/api`)**

  * Ensure the API is running on `:8080` (`npm run dev` starts both).
* **Docker runs but CSS looks wrong**

  * Rebuild after Tailwind config changes: `docker compose build --no-cache`.
  * Ensure the app is built (`npm run build`) before running the Node server image.
* **PWA “Install” doesn’t appear**

  * Use the built preview (`npm run preview`) or serve production build over HTTPS.
  * Check DevTools → Application → Manifest & Service Worker for errors.
